The OWASP AppSec conference in Europe is an established and premier venue for web applications leaders, software engineers, researchers and visionaries from all over the world. OWASP AppSec Europe gathers the application security community in a 5-days event to share and discuss novel ideas, initiatives and advancements. The 2017 conference will take place in Belfast from May 8th to 12th 2017, with papers/talks presented on 11th and 12th May.

## Topics

For our event, we are looking for "the next", cutting edge research in the context of web applications, secure development, security management and privacy. Our goal is to give both academic researchers and industry practitioners the possibility to share their latest findings with the rest of the community, including coverage via our media channels. It won't be a knockout criteria if your talk has been presented before but we would appreciate if you would let us know.  

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following:

* Novel web vulnerabilities and countermeasures
* New technologies, paradigms, tools
* OWASP tools or projects in practice
* Secure development: frameworks, best practices, secure coding, methods, processes, SDLC
* Browser security
* Mobile security and security for the mobile web
* Cloud security
* REST/SOAP security
* Security of frameworks
* Large-scale security assessments of web applications and services
* Privacy risks in the web and the cloud
* Management topics in Application Security: Business Risks, Awareness Programs, Project Management, Managing SDLC

To ensure the best talks available are presented at AppSec Europe we are incorporating blind reading as part of our process.  This means that names and job titles will be removed when the paper abstract is being reviewed.  All speakers will be given access to speaker mentorship, we especially encourage first time speakers to take advantage of this service.
