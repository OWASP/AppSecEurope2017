## Women in AppSec

Women in AppSec is kicking it up a notch at AppSec EU 2017 and we want YOU to join us! Make sure you stop by during the week to check out our events and to learn more about the group.

Events are free to attend and do not require a conference ticket.

Monday, May 8, 2017<br>
6:00-9:00 pm<br>
<span style="color: #c5008f">Networking Session</span></div>
On Monday 8th May at 6:00 pm in the Waterfront Conference Centre, we will have a group of mentors each give a brief talk about their experience followed by an "unconference" event. During the "unconference" event, we will break into groups to discuss popular technical topics. This will be a fantastic opportunity to engage in mentoring relationships and hear from women in the field.
You can sign up for this free event on Meetup.com here:
