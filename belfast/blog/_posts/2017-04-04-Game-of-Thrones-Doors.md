title: Game of Thrones Doors
---

In 2004 Storm Gertrude hit Northern Ireland.  And hit it hard.  5,000 homes were left without power.  And the Game of Thrones location and 400 year old tourist attraction, The Dark Hedges suffered badly. The County Antrim beauty spot saw many of it's famous trees felled, leaving a deep scar where the historic had stood.  But amongst the devastation, one thing remained.  Wood. And lots of it.

Tourism Ireland came up with an idea and took matters - and the ancient wood - into their own hands.  Over 10 weeks, the trees that were felled that day were lovingly transformed into 10 beautifully crafted and unique doors, each depicting an episode from Game of Thrones, Season 6.

World class illustrators and master craftsmen, were given free rein to interpret the storylines from an episode from Season 6, carving a unique eulogy into the historic timber.  Each week a new door was installed in a local pub of a Game of Thrones filming location.   Together these beautiful doors form a tour through Season 6, that spans the length and breadth of Northern Ireland.  From The Fullerton Arms, Ballintoy in the north of County Antrim, to Fiddlers Green, Portaferry in the South of County Down, east to the haunted Ballygalley Castle Hotel, each door is a celebration of local history and craftsmanship that make for a great introduction to Northern Irish tourism!

What began as a tragedy is now a permanent celebration of Game of Thrones, embedded in Northern Irish culture - and our historic wood! If you want to see the doors for yourself, check out the list and the following link: [https://youtu.be/kGAAPPLmWTw](https://youtu.be/kGAAPPLmWTw)
